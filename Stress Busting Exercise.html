        <h2>Exercise 1: Deep Breathing</h2>
        <p>Deep breathing can help relax your mind and body. Try the 4-7-8 breathing technique: inhale through the nose for 4 seconds, hold the breath for 7 seconds, and exhale through the mouth for 8 seconds.</p>
        <button onclick="startBreathingExercise('Deep Breathing')">Start Exercise</button>

        <h2>Exercise 2: Progressive Muscle Relaxation</h2>
        <p>This exercise involves tensing and relaxing different muscle groups to release tension. Start with your toes and work your way up to your head.</p>
        <button onclick="startMuscleRelaxationExercise('Progressive Muscle Relaxation')">Start Exercise</button>

        <h2>Exercise 3: Mindfulness Meditation</h2>
        <p>Mindfulness meditation helps you focus on the present moment and let go of stress. Find a quiet place, sit comfortably, and focus on your breath or a calming word or phrase.</p>
