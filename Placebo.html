    <h2>What is Placebo Therapy?</h2>
    <p>Placebo therapy involves using treatments that have no therapeutic effect but that patients believe are effective. It can include sham procedures, sugar pills, or other interventions that do not contain active ingredients. Despite lacking specific therapeutic properties, placebo therapy can sometimes lead to real improvements in patients' symptoms due to the power of belief and expectation.</p>
